# R401Blog Academic Project

For our REST courses, we had to create a REST API to handle blog's article. It was also required to manage authorisation with a JWT for publisher and moderator, with each role having different access to the methods.

URL of the API : https://nathan.chaissac.com/blogR401/appServer.php

Four implemented method are : GET, POST, PUT et DELETE

Authentification API is available at : https://nathan.chaissac.com/blogR401/authServer.php
